During my internship at **Actwise**, I simulated and analyzed multiple ransomware variants such as **Lockbit 3.0**, **WannaCry**, **Trigona**, and **Akira**.  
The goal was to understand infection methods, encryption processes, and detection evasion.

I later developed a custom proof-of-concept ransomware to test endpoint protection solutions like **CyberArk EPM/PAM**, which helped us evaluate defense effectiveness against real-world threats.
