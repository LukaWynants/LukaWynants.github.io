**About this project**  

This project examines the security of WPA2 wireless networks, focusing on how common vulnerabilities can be exploited through techniques such as the 4-way handshake and PMKID-based attacks.  
Through this research, I performed both theoretical and practical analysis to understand how WPA2 operates under the hood, how attackers can compromise it, and which detection and mitigation methods can effectively reduce these risks.  

The goal of this project is to raise awareness of the weaknesses in legacy Wi-Fi encryption standards and highlight the importance of implementing stronger security practices in modern wireless environments.
