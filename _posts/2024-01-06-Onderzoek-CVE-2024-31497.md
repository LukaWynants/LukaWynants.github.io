**About this project**


This project explores a vulnerability in PuTTY’s ECDSA implementation (CVE-2024-31497). The flaw originates from a biased nonce generation during digital signature creation, allowing an attacker to recover a user’s private SSH key after analyzing around 58 signatures.
<p>
Through this research, I performed a threat analysis to better understand the risk and potential attack vectors. The goal is to raise awareness about the issue and demonstrate how to verify if your system is affected and mitigate the vulnerability effectively.
